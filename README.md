# Virpil-Python-Control

A simple python app to control a DJI Tello drone with a Virpil HOTAS
- Specificlly, this code works best with a Virpil grip. However, it should be relatively easy to change the button ID's for any other HOTAS or even a gamepad or keyboard.

Test.py can be used to determine butto ID's on your joyststick.
