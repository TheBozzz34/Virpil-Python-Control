# Virpil-Python-Control

A simple python app to control a DJI Tello drone with a Virpil HOTAS
- Specificlly, this code works best with a [WarBRD-D Base](https://virpil-controls.us.com/vpc-warbrd-d-base.html) and [VPC MongoosT-50CM2 Grip](https://virpil-controls.us.com/vpc-mongoost-50cm2-grip.html). However, it should be relatively easy to change the button ID's for any other HOTAS or even a gamepad or keyboard.

Test.py can be used to determine butto ID's on your joyststick.
